# Wall of Coins

## API Integration Example

## Publisher Accounts

Our API is free to use; however, you must create a Publisher Account with us
if you want to receive commissions for contributing to our community. Why is
this commission based? Because you are helping buyers and sellers, and many
times there is some sort of fee acquired -- you have a right to this! All
commissions are paid in bitcoin *only*.

Furthermore, to help combat malicious "click jacking", a Publisher Account is
required if you wish to use the iframe web module.

To open a Publisher Account, call 866-841-COIN (2646) or write an email to
support@wallofcoins.com with the subject, "New Publisher Account".

Thank you! :)
